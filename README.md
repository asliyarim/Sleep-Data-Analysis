# Sleep Data Analysis Project

## Motivation

In today's digitally-driven world, it is typical to sacrifice sleep for greater screen time, academic expectations, and variable degrees of physical activity. As a student, I have observed variations in my sleep habits, particularly during midterm examinations and days with high phone usage. This project aims to investigate how my screen time, step count, and midterm dates affect my sleep quality, as recorded by my Apple Watch.

## Data Source

- **Sleep Data**: Collected from my Apple Watch, which tracks variables like total sleep hours, REM sleep duration, and overall sleep quality.
- **Step Count**: Obtained from my iPhoneâ€™s Health app, recording daily step counts.
- **Screen Time**: Sourced from my iPhone, detailing daily screen time usage.
- **Midterm Dates**: Manually recorded in a JSON file, noting the dates of my midterm exams.

## Data Collection Method

- **Automated Data**: Sleep data, step counts, and screen time are automatically collected by my devices.
- **Manual Data**: Midterm exam dates are manually inputted to align with the automated data for correlation analysis.

## Data Analysis

### Techniques to Be Used

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing data to ensure consistency and accuracy across all datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and identifying initial patterns or anomalies.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculating correlation coefficients to determine relationships between variables (e.g., screen time vs. sleep quality).
4. **Statistical Testing**: Applying tests like Pearson or Spearman correlation to assess the significance of observed relationships.
5. **Visualization**: Creating graphs and charts to illustrate findings clearly.

## Expected Findings

Based on personal experiences and preliminary observations, I have formulated the following hypotheses:

- **Screen Time**: I assume a negative association between screen time and sleep quality. Increased screen usage may lead to decreased sleep quality, fewer sleep hours, and shorter REM sleep duration.
- **Midterm Dates**: I expect my sleep quality to decrease during midterm exam periods due to increased academic stress, potentially leading to shorter and less restorative sleep.
- **Step Count**: I hypothesize a positive correlation between daily step count and sleep quality. Increased physical activity might enhance sleep metrics, resulting in longer and more restorative sleep periods.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

- **Sample Size**: The data is limited to my personal records over a specific timeframe, which may not be representative of broader patterns.
- **External Factors**: Uncontrolled variables such as diet, caffeine intake, and stress levels could influence sleep quality but are not accounted for.
- **Device Accuracy**: Reliance on Apple Watch and iPhone sensors, which may have measurement inaccuracies.

### Future Plans

- **Extended Data Collection**: Continue gathering information over a longer time period to improve reliability.
- **Advanced Modeling**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict sleep quality based on collected data, including step count, midterm dates, and screen time.
