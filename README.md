# Sleep Data Analysis - DSA210 Term Project

## Motivation

In today's digitally-driven world, it is typical to sacrifice sleep for greater screen time, academic expectations, and variable degrees of physical activity. As a student, I have seen variations in my sleep habits, particularly during midterm examinations and days with high phone usage. This project will look into how my screen time, step count, and midterm dates affect my sleep quality, as recorded by my Apple Watch.

## Data Source

I used two types of data collection methods. These are automated data and manual data. My automated data includes sleep data, step count, and screen time. Sleep data is collected from my Apple Watch, which tracks variables like total sleep hours, REM sleep duration, and overall sleep quality. Step count is obtained from my iPhone’s Health app, recording daily step counts. Screen time data comes from my iPhone, detailing daily screen time usage. Manually, I recorded my midterm examinations’ dates in a JSON file.

## Data Analysis

In my project’s further steps, I will use these techniques in order: Data Preprocessing for cleaning and organizing data to ensure consistency and accuracy across all datasets, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for visualizing data distributions and identifying initial patterns or anomalies, Correlation Analysis to calculate correlation coefficients to determine relationships between variables (e.g., screen time vs. sleep quality), Statistical tests, such as Pearson or Spearman correlation, can be used to evaluate the importance of observed connections. Visualization techniques, like creating graphs and charts, can help to clearly demonstrate findings.

## Expected Findings

Based on my personal experiences and preliminary observations, I have a hypothesis that increased screen time and midterm exam periods negatively impact sleep quality, reducing total sleep hours and REM duration, while higher daily step counts positively influence sleep quality, leading to longer and more restorative sleep.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

My project has certain limitations, such as a restricted sample size, as the data is limited to my personal records collected over a specific timeframe, which may not accurately represent broader patterns. Additionally, uncontrolled variables, such as diet, caffeine usage, and stress levels, which could affect sleep quality, are not accounted for. Lastly, the project relies on the accuracy of Apple Watch and iPhone sensors, which may have inherent measurement inaccuracies.

### Future Plans

My future plans include expanding my data collection to obtain more reliable results, and I plan to use advanced modeling techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict sleep quality based on data collected, including step count, midterm dates, and screen time.
