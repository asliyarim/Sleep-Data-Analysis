# Sleep Data Analysis - DSA210 Term Project

## Motivation

In today's digitally-driven world, it is typical to sacrifice sleep for greater screen time, academic expectations, and variable degrees of physical activity. As a student, I have observed variations in my sleep habits, particularly during midterm examinations and days with high phone usage. This project will look into how my screen time, step count, and midterm dates affect my sleep quality, as recorded by my Apple Watch.

## Data Source

I used two types of data collection methods: automated data and manual data.

- **Automated Data**:
  - **Sleep Data**: Collected from my Apple Watch, which tracks variables like total sleep hours, REM sleep duration, and overall sleep quality.
  - **Step Count**: Obtained from my iPhoneâ€™s Health app, recording daily step counts.
  - **Screen Time**: Sourced from my iPhone, detailing daily screen time usage.

- **Manual Data**:
  - I manually recorded the dates of my midterm examinations in a JSON file.

## Data Analysis

In the future steps of my project, I plan to use the following techniques in order:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing data to ensure consistency and accuracy across all datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and identifying initial patterns or anomalies.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculating correlation coefficients to determine relationships between variables (e.g., screen time vs. sleep quality).
4. **Statistical Testing**: Applying tests like Pearson or Spearman correlation to assess the significance of observed relationships.
5. **Visualization**: Creating graphs and charts to illustrate findings clearly.

## Expected Findings

Based on my personal experiences and preliminary observations, I hypothesize that increased screen time and midterm exam periods negatively impact sleep quality, reducing total sleep hours and REM duration. Conversely, higher daily step counts are expected to positively influence sleep quality, leading to longer and more restorative sleep.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

My project has certain limitations:
- **Sample Size**: The data is restricted to my personal records collected over a specific timeframe, which may not accurately represent broader patterns.
- **External Factors**: Uncontrolled variables, such as diet, caffeine usage, and stress levels, which could affect sleep quality, are not accounted for.
- **Device Accuracy**: The project relies on the accuracy of Apple Watch and iPhone sensors, which may have inherent measurement inaccuracies.

### Future Plans

My future plans include:
- **Expanding Data Collection**: Continuing to gather more data to obtain reliable results.
- **Advanced Modeling**: Using advanced modeling techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict sleep quality based on data collected, including step count, midterm dates, and screen time.
